# 🧩 Grey Lantern — CTFs

This repository contains notes, write-ups and learning artifacts from
capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges relevant to OSINT, web analysis and
investigative thinking.

The focus is on:
- methodology and reasoning
- ethical boundaries
- learning outcomes, not exploitation

Write-ups are selective and may omit or abstract sensitive details.

🕯️ *Learning through structured challenge and reflection.*
